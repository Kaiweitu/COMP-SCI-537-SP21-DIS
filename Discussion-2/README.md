## xv6 Introduction
xv6 is simple x86-based operating system developed in MIT for teaching purpose. We will use a emulator named QEMU to run our xv6 operating system.
### Basic makefile
Make is a build automation tool that build executable program by reading a file named Makefile. Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule is defined as following
~~~[bash]
target: prerequisites
    recipe (command)
    ...
~~~
- A `target` is usually the name of the file generated by the command; examples of targets are executable or object files. 
- A `prerequisite` is the dependency file required to build target. Remaking will only happen if any of the dependency file changes. If there is no dependency file declared, then make will check whether the target file exists or not.
- A `recipe` is a command to build the target.
A simple rule could look like
~~~[bash]
my-head: my-head.c
    gcc -Werror -Wall -g my-head.c -o my-head
~~~
Note that there will be exactly one tab before the command. In addition, a target can also be the name of a task such as `clean`. In this case, we will need explicitly declare it to be phony.
~~~
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -rf *.o 
~~~
### Compilation and debugging
As we mentioned above, we use QEMU to run xv6. The makefile provided by the xv6 handles anything we need to run source in QEMU. If we wants to compile and run the xv6, we execute
~~~[bash]
make qemu-nox
~~~
We can also use gdb to debug the xv6 code when running in the QEMU. Following steps:
1. First, we need to add gdb init file into the auto loading path
~~~[bash]
vim ~/.gdbinit
# Add following command into this file
# add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/your/xv6/.gdbinit
~~~
2. Secondly, inside the source code directory, we run
~~~[bash]
make qemu-nox-gdb
~~~
3. On the SAME machine, inside the same source code direcotry, we run
~~~
gdb
~~~
